2009-05-26 Boris Mikhaylov <http://www.tmn.ru/~bor>

	3.1.0

	* bs2bconvert/bs2bstream - add switch of crossfeed level
	by feed level and cut frequency.
	* Win32 library of libsndfile v1.0.19 migrated to v1.0.20.
	* Fixed for higher compile warning level.
	* Extended cut frequency set from [300..1000] to [300..2000] Hz
	(BS2B_MAXFCUT)
	* Apply compile fix patch for FreeBSD

	* Changed and extended presets.

2009-03-24 Boris Mikhaylov <http://www.tmn.ru/~bor>
	* Added unsigned 16/24/32 integer handling.

2009-03-23 Boris Mikhaylov <http://www.tmn.ru/~bor>
	* Normalization of integer samples are removed.

2009-02-18 Sebastian Pipping <sebastian@pipping.org>
	* Shared lib (*nix) project started.

2009-02-17 Boris Mikhaylov <http://www.tmn.ru/~bor>
	* Sources are reorganized.

2009-02-02 Boris Mikhaylov <http://www.tmn.ru/~bor>

	2.2.0

	* Dynamic variables for multiply instances are used.
	* Compiled by MS VC++ 2008.
	* Nothing changed for a sound.

2006-11-14 Boris Mikhaylov <http://www.tmn.ru/~bor>

	2.1.0

	* Three new 'Easy' levels added.
	'High easy' level is close to Chu Moy's version of crossfeeder
	(http://headwize.com/projects/showfile.php?file=cmoy1_prj.htm)

2006-09-22 Boris Mikhaylov <http://www.tmn.ru/~bor>

	2.0.0

	* Change of license.
	* Package divided by library and plugins.
	* foobar2000 0.8 plugin package created.

2006-03-28 Boris Mikhaylov <http://www.tmn.ru/~bor>

	2.0.0b2 - test prerelease.

	* New plugin for foobar2000 0.9.
	* Plugin for foobar2000 0.8 have removed.
	* New look of configuration windows of plugins.
	* Default coefficients of default middle crossfeed level and of
	44100 Hz sampling rate was staticaly implemeted to bs2b library.

2006-03-07 Boris Mikhaylov <http://www.tmn.ru/~bor>

	2.0.0b - test prerelease.
	
	* The new high frequency boost filter have implemented.
	The old version	of high-boost filter have been realized
	by two-step recursive filter for computation power conserving
	by subtraction of low-pass filter signal. The new method is
	a one-step recursive filter. It has done to provide an adjusted
	cut frequency value for more smooth frequency responce of
	resulting signal.
	* The new clipping feature by checking of [-1, +1] range of
	double float operations have implemented against possible
	overloads of signal level.
	* Global gain have calculated from levels of low frequency range
	like in first release. This is don't makes overload now due to
	the new frequency responce and to the new clipping feature.
	* New functions have added to library for various integer
	audio data processing.
	* New tuning method have implemented by three preset levels.
	* Updatted Winamp 2 plugin have included to package.
	
2005-11-02 Boris Mikhaylov <http://www.tmn.ru/~bor>

	1.1.0b - test prerelease.
	
	* Winamp2 plugin are unchanged and excluded from test package.
	* Add high frequencies boost functions to bs2b library (see bs2b.h).
	* Make less global gain against overloading.
	* Add high frequencies boost option [-h] to bs2b-convert.
	* Get out MSVCR71.DLL dependency from foobar2000 plugin.
	* Create configuration window for foobar2000 plugin
	with options like -h and -m in bs2b-convert.

2005-10-26 Boris Mikhaylov <http://www.tmn.ru/~bor>

	1.0.0 - first release of bs2b.
